# lavaldi.com

Here I share what I learn in my path as software developer. It has transformed over the years - from Jekyll, to Hubspot, to Nextein, to Gatsby and finally to Next.js/React/MDX.

_Based on [leerob.io](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/)_

## Built Using

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [MDX](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Running Locally

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/lavaldi/lavaldi.com.git
$ cd lavaldi.com

```
